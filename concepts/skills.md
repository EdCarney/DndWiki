# Overview

Skills are subsets of abilities that you can have proficiency in.

# Skill Proficiencies

Being proficient in a skill means that you can add a proficiency modifier if you have a check where that skill is applicable.

During an ability check, there may be an applicable skill that you can use. E.g. if you have proficiency in Perception and you have a WIS (Perception) check, you would roll one d20, then add both your WIS modifier and you Perception proficiency bonus.
