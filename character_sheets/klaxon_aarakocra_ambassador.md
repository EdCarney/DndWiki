# Story

- grew up in a large Aarakocra aerie
- strong sense of nobility; wants to serve his people
- is pretty decent at the warfare
- suffers a traumatic injury during a territorial invasion from a rival aerie (let's call them Russia)
- his aerie lost the battle and is now significantly smaller in size
- still wanting to serve, but no longer fit for arial combat, he becomes an ambassador
- goal is to get support from land-based cities to help take back their former territory
- the first city he is sent to is fantasy baltimore (fbmore) he is bad at diplomacy; much better at killing
- the corruption in fbmore's politics also doesn't help; this is not common in the Aarakocra cities/aeries
- he is unfamiliar with human/land-based culture and is generally trusting and gullible; easily swindled
- like many Aarakocra he is terrified of confinement (e.g. in cages or trapped underground)
