# Story

- grew up in a large Aarakocra aerie
- strong sense of nobility; wants to serve his people
- is pretty decent at the warfare
- suffers a traumatic injury during a territorial invasion from a rival aerie (let's call them Russia)
- his aerie lost the battle and is now significantly smaller in size
- still wanting to serve, but no longer fit for arial combat, he becomes an ambassador
- goal is to get support from land-based cities to help take back their former territory
- the first city he is sent to is fantasy baltimore (fbmore) he is bad at diplomacy; much better at killing
- the corruption in fbmore's politics also doesn't help; this is not common in the Aarakocra cities/aeries
- he is unfamiliar with human/land-based culture and is generally trusting and gullible; easily swindled
- like many Aarakocra he is terrified of confinement (e.g. in cages or trapped underground)

## Battle Master

## Student of War

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Choice: Smith's Tools

Smith's Tools

- Allow you to work metal, beating it to alter its shape, repair damage, or work raw ingots into useful items.
- Includes: hammers, tongs, charcoal, rags, and a whetstone.
- Your expertise lends you additional insight when examining metal objects, such as weapons.
- You can spot clues and make deductions that others might overlook when an investigation involves armor, weapons, or other metalwork.
- With access to your tools and an open flame hot enough to make metal pliable, you can restore 10 hit points to a damaged metal object for each hour of work.

| Activity                            | DC |
|-------------------------------------|----|
| Sharpen a dull blade                | 10 |
| Repair a suit of armor              | 15 |
| Sunder a nonmagical metal object    | 15 |

### Maneuvers

- **Disarming Attack**: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.
- **Menacing Attack**: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
- **Parry**: When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
>
> Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
