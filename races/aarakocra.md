# Overview

They are basically big bird people.

They look and act like big birds and they really like the sky. What does acting like a bird mean? Cleaning their feathers frequently, distracted by shiny objects.

They often appear alert and ready for action. They are terrified by the idea of confinement (i.e. within buildings, but especially underground).

They have difficulty with the idea of ownership, they see the earth as a natural resource that they take from and contribute back towards. This can make them appear to be a nuisance as they take/steal things (shiny objects, livestock, harvests) that don't belong to them.
