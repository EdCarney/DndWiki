# Notes

- so God (read: our GM) has lost the notebook with all the plans...

    - Spacecat has clearly been squatting here some time
    - but everything else is great!

- X is the first to rise
    - and NO he doesn't cockadoodledoo and so he doesn't wake everyone up you BUNCH OF RACISTS
- X wants to take a look around the observatory

    - there is a side closet in the observatory that Spacecat has been using for a kitchen
    - this is where Spacecat seldom prepares food
    - find some coffee, wine, moldy bread, and...a white box
