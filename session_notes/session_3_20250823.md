# Notes

- back in the sewer, face-to-face with a super crab
    - fun fact: the 'face' of a crab is the 'cephalothorax'!
- a ripple in time! the initiative order wiggles
    - E, K, X, M, A is first now
- E takes a swing with his crab mallet
    - it glances off the crab's armor (which apparently they make with detritis and such from the sewer)
- K lands a dirty 20 fireball right in between the crabs eye...stalks?
    - fun fact: the area between a crab's eyes is the 'rostrum'!
    - crab is blushing now
    - 'notice me senpai'
- X takes two big swings and chops off one of the crabs claws
    - boy howdy that would probably steam up good
    - but like, would you want to eat a bay crab *in the bay*?
- crab real mad at X, X is snipped and grappled by the crab
- M casts Id Insinuation
    - "...unleash a torrent of conflicting desires in the mind of one creature..."
    - must make a wisdom saving throw
- God: "incredible news about the wisdom of crabs y'all"
